## Key Features of the Marketplace Software


Our pre-built local services marketplace software comes equipped with a wide range of features and functionalities.

### Profile Creation/Registration

The software enables both clients and taskers to register/create accounts by providing all important information. A KYC verification is conducted to verify the authenticity of these profiles. Users can edit their profiles and make necessary changes as per need.

### Job Posting

Through this feature, clients can post jobs on the platform by choosing a category or sub category. To make it easier for taskers to understand the job, they can explain it by using images and videos.

### Bidding

Taskers can post jobs on the service marketplace. They can also send proposals to clients along with their charges.

### Live Chat and Alerts

The software allows clients and taskers to communicate with each other through direct messaging. The platform also sends real-time notifications to users, informing them about new jobs and service requests.

### Escrow Payment System

The service marketplace PHP script also includes an escrow system, which safely holds the payments of a tasker. Once the tasker successfully completes the task, the payment is then released to the tasker.

### Multilingual and Multicurrency Support

Our MyBuilder clone script offers multilingual and multicurrency support. By using this software solution, you can operate your business anywhere in the world.

### Tasker Dashboard

The tasker dashboard feature enables taskers to view their pending, ongoing, and completed projects. Through this panel, they can also view their earnings summary and the withdrawal requests they have sent to the clients.

### Switch Profile

The switch profile feature enables users to use their profile both as a tasker and as an employer, as per their requirements.

### Admin Dashboard

The software also includes a powerful admin dashboard through which the admin can view the total number of users and jobs on the service marketplace.

### Dispute Resolution

While coordinating on a project, clients and taskers may appear at some sort of disagreement. Our local services marketplace software includes a dispute resolution feature through which such issues are addressed.

## Revenue Streams Integrated in the Software

Our ready-made service marketplace software enables you to generate revenue primarily through two built-in streams. However, you can add more streams if you want.

### Platform Fee

You can collect an amount from the taskers and clients for using your platform. You can simply collect an amount from the earnings of the taskers once they get paid at the end of a project. Similarly, charge an amount from the clients while they post jobs on your marketplace.
